Apache Friends developed XAMPP, which is free software. Apache distributions for MariaDB, PHP, Perl, and Apache server are all part of the XAMPP software package. It functions essentially as a local host or server as well. 
Any operating system can use it as the local server. Using the XAMPP server software, one may test MySQL, PHP, Apache, and Perl projects on their own computer.
The letters X stand for Cross-platform, Apache server, MariaDB, PHP, and Perl in the acronym XAMPP. When something is described as cross-platform, it usually means that it may be utilised with any computer and any operating system.
The MYSQL team's MariaDB database server is the most well-known one.
